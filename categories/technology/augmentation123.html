                <h2>What is Human Agumentation...?</h2>
                <p class="im">Human augmentation is the term for technologies that improve human capabilities. They primarily work to elevate human performance, health or quality of life. Popular examples of human augmentation technology are devices such as cochlear implants or robotic limbs.</p>

         <h2>How does Human Agmentation works?
</h2>
<p>Human Augmentation works by enhancing human abilities through technology. Not only is human augmentation able to improve existing skills, but humans can also access new skills using technology.

    There are three different types of human augmentation:
    
      Sensory. This technology is used mostly to restore abilities or compensate for impairments. Sensory augmentation is the enhancement of human senses by interpreting multisensory information.
      Action. Augmented actions focus on improving human’s physical abilities. Technology advancements have allowed people to have more precise functions from their artificial limbs, with robotics playing a large role. Augmented action technology can also improve human capabilities.
      Cognitive. This looks at how computers and technology can assist the cognitive process. Augmented cognition technology aims to help improve decision-making, memory and attention.</p>

            <h2>What are the technologies used in Human Agumentation
            </h2>
<p>AI and machine learning (ML) is used to help improve human capabilities in various ways:</p>
<p><big>  What is AI analytics? </big>Predictive AI analytics can predict trends and events that humans alone may not be able to. Virtual assistants also work to aid human workers by scheduling and setting reminders, offering insightful recommendations, and collecting and presenting relevant information. An example of this is agent assist in contact centers.</p>
<p><big>What is agent assist? </big> Agent assist technology provides live support for contact center agents, offering guidance, problem-solving pathways and presenting relevant information based on the issues and behaviors it detects.</p>
<p><big>What is a chatbot? </big> Chatbots can be used to help people find the information they need more quickly, and be presented with solutions and advice for queries and problems.</p>
