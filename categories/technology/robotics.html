        <h2>About Robotics</h2>
        <p>Robotics is a multidisciplinary field of engineering and science that involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. A robot is a machine or a mechanical device that can be programmed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics encompasses various aspects, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
