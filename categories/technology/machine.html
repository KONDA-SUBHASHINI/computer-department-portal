    <h2>Types of Machine Learning Approaches</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supervised Learning: This involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, enabling it to make predictions on new data.</li>
      <li>Unsupervised Learning: Here, the model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns or structures within the data on its own. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.</li>
      <li>Semi-supervised Learning: This combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning, where the model is trained on a partially labeled dataset.</li>
      <li>Reinforcement Learning: In this approach, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing it to learn the optimal behavior through trial and error.</li>
